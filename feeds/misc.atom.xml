The key difference between online learning and batch learning (or &amp;#8216;offline&amp;#8217; learning) techniques, is that in online learning the mapping is updated after the arrival of every new datapoint in a scalable fashion, whereas batch techniques are used when one has access to the entire training dataset at once. Online learning could be used in the case of a process occurring in time, for example the value of a stock given its history and other external factors, in which case the mapping updates as time goes on and we get more and more&amp;nbsp;samples.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="online learning"></category></entry></feed>
